# Form-Vaildation
I recently created a form validation project with fields for Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password. Here’s what it checks:

Name Validation: If the name has fewer than 5 characters, a popup will appear, notifying the user that a minimum of 5 characters is required.
Phone Number Validation: The form checks if the phone number is exactly 10 digits; otherwise, it displays a message to enter a valid 10-digit number.
Email Validation: It ensures the email contains the "@" symbol and other basic format requirements.
Password and Confirm Password Match: It checks if both the Password and Confirm Password fields match; if not, a message pops up.
Additional Password Rules:
The password cannot be the same as the username.
If the password is set to “password,” a warning appears, prompting the user to choose a more secure password.
The best part? The form is fully responsive, making it easy to use on both mobile and desktop.
